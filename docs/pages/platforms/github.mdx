## Basic example
See the following minimal example showing how to publish the `remapJar` task to GitHub:
```groovy
publishMods {
    file = remapJar.archiveFile
    changelog = "Changelog"
    type = STABLE
    modLoaders.add("fabric")

    github {
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        repository = "Example/MyMod"
        commitish = "main" // This is the branch the release tag will be created from
    }
}

```
## Multiple releases
You can create multiple GitHub destinations by specifying a name like so:
```groovy
publishMods {
    github("githubProjectA") {
        // Configure github settings for project A here
    }

    github("githubProjectB") {
        // Configure github settings for project B here
    }
}
```
This will create 2 separate GitHub releases.

## Parent releases
If you wish to upload files to a GitHub release created by another task either in the same project or another subproject, you can use the `parent` option.
This is useful where you have multiple subprojects that you want to publish to a single release, the following example shows how a root project can create the release and subprojects can upload files to it:

#### Root project
```groovy
publishMods {
    github {
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        repository = "Example/MyMod"
        commitish = "main"
        tagName = "release/1.0.0"

        // Allow the release to be initially created without any files.
        allowEmptyFiles = true
    }
}
```

#### Subproject
When using the `parent` option, only the `accessToken` and files are required, the other options are forcefully inherited from the parent task.
```groovy
publishMods {
    github {
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN")

        // Specify the root project's github task to upload files to
        parent project(":").tasks.named("publishGithub")
    }
}
```

## All options
See the following example showing all the Github specific options:
```groovy
publishMods {
    github {
        accessToken = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        repository = "Example/MyMod"
        commitish = "main"
        tagName = "release/1.0.0"

        // Optionally set the announcement title used by the discord publisher
        announcementTitle = "Download from GitHub"

        // Upload the files to a previously created release, by providing another github publish task
        // This is useful in multi-project builds where you want to publish multiple subprojects to a single release
        parent tasks.named("publishGithub")

        // Optionally allow the release to be created without any attached files.
        // This is useful when you have subprojects using the parent option that you want to publish a single release.
        allowEmptyFiles = true
    }
}
```
